## Selected Projects ##

### Score Vector _(Masters Thesis)_ ###

Designed and implemented a new evaluation scheme for RoboCup Rescue Agent
Simulation Competition 2009, Graz, Austria. The Score Vector, as the name
suggests, is a vector of parameters. The dimensions of the 'vector' are the
important factors that inï¬‚uence the game. These parameters monitor the game
and provide analysis at a microscopic level. It poses a multi-parameter
optimization challenge and many other multi-agent challenges to the
participants.

### Database Driven RoboCup Rescue Simulation Platform ###

Designed and implemented a new RoboCup Rescue simulation platform which can
simulate thousands of agents in real time compared to only 150-200 agents
that the original version of the simulator.  Using main memory to store
simulation data in real time is a bottleneck when it comes to large scale
simulations. DDRRS makes use of data in a distributed database to overcome
this problem.

### Multi Robotic Coverage Maximization ###

Designed and implemented multi-agent coordination algorithms for AmigoBots
to navigate, scout and build a map of an area previously unexplored.
Obstacle avoidance is done using input from sonars available on the
amigobots.
