## Selected Projects ##

### Web development at Amazon ###

> End to end design and development of internal websites.  One of them is based
> on Rails and provides analytics on how engineers spend their time on
> operations. Another website, built using Python Flask framework, visualizes
> data from service logs and provides insight into computations that occurred
> during an API call. I was also involved in the development of other internal
> tools and gained good experience in full stack web development.

### Other web development work ###

> I worked on the front end for [42events.com](http://42events.com)

> Created [blockbusters](http://blockbusters.herokuapp.com) using meteor.

### Score Vector _(Masters Thesis)_ ###
 
> Designed and implemented a new evaluation scheme for RoboCup Rescue Agent
> Simulation Competition. The Score Vector, as the name suggests, is a vector
> of parameters which monitor the game and act as microscopic details for
> analysis. It primarily poses a multi-parameter optimization challenge among
> other multi-agent challenges to the participants.

### Database Driven RoboCup Rescue Simulation Platform ###

> Designed and implemented a new RoboCup Rescue simulation platform which can
> simulate thousands of agents in real time compared to only 150-200 agents
> that the original version of the simulator. Using main memory to store
> simulation data in real time is a bottleneck when it comes to large scale
> simulations. DDRRS makes use of data in a distributed database to overcome
> this problem.

### Multi Robotic Coverage Maximization ###

> Designed and implemented multi-agent coordination algorithms for AmigoBots
> to navigate, scout and build a map of an area previously unexplored.
> Obstacle avoidance is done using input from sonars available on the
> amigobots.
