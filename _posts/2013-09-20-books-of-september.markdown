## Arjuna - The Saga of a Pandava Prince
### _Anuja Chandramouli_

Avoidable. Especially if you have read any other critically acclaimed Mahabharata related works. The narrative is not appealing and the anachronisms did not make any logical sense. Gratuitous use of fancy words did not help at all. Having said that, the book has a healthy amount of focus on Karna's character which, I think, most other writers pay less attention to. The author was also sucessful in being impartial to the pandavas. Pandavas or Arjuna were not elevated to hero material. They were instead rendered as regular humans with flaws like most of us.

## Dongri to Dubai
### _Hussain Zaidi_

I found this to be an exceptional page turner. The writing style was impressive and unique. This is probably what you'd get when an experienced crime reporter joins hands with a a seasoned screen writer. Well, in this case they're both the same person.

The book is about six decades of Bombay Mafia. It begins with the birth of smuggling business in the Bombay port. This was just after independence and couple of decades before the the rise of Dawood Ibrahim. After that, the book mainly deals with glorifying Dawood and his empire. Having said that, the book doesn't actually try to justify any of his acts. It pays equal attention to both sides of the coin. It showcases apparent facts with bits and pieces of action-movie inspired imagination.
