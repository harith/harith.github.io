### The Secret of Nagas ###

#### Amish Tripathi  ####

As bad as the first one. I have nothing else to say. I’ll probably read the rest of the story on wikipedia for closure.

### Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance ###

#### Robert M. Pirsig  ####

Just like the disclaimer says, this is neither a guide to motorcycle maintenance nor Zen Buddhism. It’s about the philosophy of quality (partly, may be). What makes some people perceive some things as good or bad? Is it subjective? If not, how do you define quality? Why are some people so reluctant to come out of their comfort zones? Such are the questions the author explored. There was a certain tone of melancholy that the author used throughout the book. That tone most definitely resonated well with the chosen topics.

I’m not sure I was able to grasp the content of the book in one read. Due to lack of eloquence, I must concede - this is some deep shit.

### Tales of Dunk and Egg ###

#### George R. R. Martin  ####

A collection of short stories about Ageon the unlikely and Sir Duncan the Tall. The story starts out as a normal heroic tale and proceeds to turn in unexpected ways. There are 3 books currently and all of them are well written in true GRRM style. I am now longing for Winds of Winter.

### A Tale of Two Cities ###

#### Charles Dickens ####

I read this because Nolan said that parts of TDKR were inspired by this story. That was probably the mistake. I should have read it like any other book. Instead, my focus was on drawing analogies between TDKR and French revolution (at which I failed miserably). The archaic prose was difficult for me and the French names did not help.

### The Girl Who Came Home ###

#### Hazel Gaynor ####

This book (inspired by a true story) is about a small group of people from Ireland, who were shown the promise of America, that decided to cross the Atlantic ocean in Titanic. The story follows ‘Maggie’ and her ordeal as the ship goes down. While most of the story resembles James Cameroon’s movie (first class, third class, the differences, the luxury etc.), this book also depicts the panic on the land as people on either sides of the Atlantic begin to hear news about the accident. The narration is beautiful and the anachronism provides a relief from the monotony of the story we all know.

### The Silmarillion ###

#### J. R. R. Tolkien ####

The first few chapters about Eru, the creation of Ainur, the discord between them and the rise of Morgoth were beautifully written. After that, it took me a while to get some momentum. There were an overwhelming number of names, places and things from the fantastic lands of middle earth.  Naturally, you can imagine my relief when I came across a reference to Galadriel about half way through the book.

Major part of this book is a brief history of the First Age of middle-earth. Owing to the brevity, the stories are generally filled with less details and more events. For example, the story of the Children of Húrin, which has an entire book of its own, gets a single chapter in The Silmarillion. Also, maps of middle earth would be immensely helpful when you read.  

Reading this felt like listening to my grandfather narrating interesting tales from mythology.  Sometimes I dozed off quickly but some stories were so good I couldn’t sleep. Even when I did, I was back in the breathtaking landscapes of Beleriand.
