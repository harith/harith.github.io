### The Hobbit
#### J R R Tolkien

The first time I read the book was when the trailer came out. I could not resist the temptation of reading it again after watching the movie and I was mildly surprised that a minor conversational reference to the stone giants turned into a huge cgi sequence in the movie. Reading this again after The Song of Ice and Fire reaffirmed my faith in Tolkien as the master of the genre.

### Animal Farm
#### George Orwell

> All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.

This is British satire at its best. It is better if you go ahead with this book knowing absolutely nothing about the story. How it evolves will be a surprise and you’ll love it when you realise what it really means.

### Immortals of Meluha
#### Amish Tripathi

Several people recommended this book. I thought I’d have to order it from flipkart but I found a Kindle version that was much cheaper. Now I wish I spent that money on filter coffee instead. The writing is bad. The language feels disconnected from the story and characters. The book is riddled with bastardized versions of beautiful sanskrit words. The conversations look like they’ve been copied from a B-grade hollywood movie. Here’s a sample for you. Feast on it.

> Vidyunmali and Mayashrenik were in their private gym, preparing for their regular sword training.
>
> ‘Vidyu…,’ cajoled Mayashrenik.
>
> ‘Don’t “Vidyu” me, Maya. You know this is wrong.’

The book has a great premise but all the promise that comes with it goes unfulfilled. Perhaps an indian language, rather than English, is more apt to the whole setting. If you are looking for historical fiction, I’d recommend a better series - Empire of the Moghul.
